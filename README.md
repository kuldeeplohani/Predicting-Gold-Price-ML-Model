# Predicting-Gold-Price-ML-Model
This repository contains code and data for a Machine Learning model that predicts the daily price of gold for the next day. The model uses historical gold price data along with other relevant indices, such as SPX(The Standard and Poor's 500)index, USO(United States Oil Fund)index, SLV(iShare Silver Trust)index and EUR/USD(Euro per USDollar).

The goal of this model is to help investors and traders make informed decisions about buying and selling gold by providing accurate predictions of future prices.

The model is built using Python 3.7 and several popular libraries, including Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn, Scipy, Matplot and Seaborn.
